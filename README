Apastat, a script that parses Apache mod_status output
and displays the data on the terminal.


Script arguments:

 -a     Show all workers, not only the active ones
 -s     Sort workers by "seconds since" column
 -c     Sort workers by client IP

 --scoreboard-key       Show Apache scoreboard key


TODO:

 * Implement "*stat" behavior
   Allow last argument to be an interval, have apastat sample data
   and show diff between intervals, like "vmstat".

 * Do argument parsing with argparse

 * Take server as an option, default to localhost
